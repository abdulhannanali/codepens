# my code pens

A repository where all my front end pens are placed.

## What's a pen?
Pen is a relatively simple project, showcasing something really good. It's what [codepen.io](https://codepen.io) is but, it's on github as a repo, and the pens will be served over [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com). Why this? Because, I love Github and it's a good place to organize shit too. 

### Structure of pens

The main goal is keeping this site simple and this should not be neglected in it's slightest sense, therefore it's necessary to keep the directory structure simple.

A pen will contain directory having the following structure

- html file
- css file
- js file
- any other files

Pen's personal dependencies will be placed in `deps` folder and the dependencies downloaded using `bower`, `npm` or any other will go into their own preferred directories such `node_modules` for npm packages.
